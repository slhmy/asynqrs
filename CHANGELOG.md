# CHANGELOG

## 2026-05-12

- Added project guidance in `AGENTS.md`.
- Established Asynq v0.26.0 as the current upstream reference baseline.
- Documented the requirement to add `Reference:` comments for upstream-derived
  implementation details.
- Documented the requirement to mark intentionally incomplete upstream behavior
  with nearby `TODO:` comments.
- Added this changelog as the required place to record future meaningful project
  changes.

## 2026-05-11

- Added `TaskState` based on Asynq v0.26.0 public task states.
  Reference: https://github.com/hibiken/asynq/blob/v0.26.0/asynq.go#L207-L250
- Added public `Task` with type name, payload, and headers based on Asynq
  `Task`, `NewTask`, and `NewTaskWithHeaders`.
  Reference: https://github.com/hibiken/asynq/blob/v0.26.0/asynq.go#L22-L73
- Marked upstream `Task` options and `ResultWriter` fields as TODOs because
  enqueue behavior and worker-side result writing are not modeled yet.
- Added Asynq `TaskMessage` protobuf schema and generated Rust bindings using
  `buf`.
  Reference: https://github.com/hibiken/asynq/blob/v0.26.0/internal/proto/asynq.proto#L1-L71
